Place to dump my autodidact shit (mostly politics and economical) - by vibe-researching using DeepSeek.

Will be updated every day - kind of a mental grind I guess

Day 1 - "What necessary academical discipline to address relationship between power structures based on political views - example - the claim that capitalism hated authoritarian government because the rich finds it hard to influence the government (without sounding like a midwit)?"

Day 2 - "I am an autodidact - but I want to learn how to learn. What academic field should I look for, to make framework of how to learn, by considering academical rigor?"
